## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required templates for [bugs](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md) or [feature requests](ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Feature Requests

Before suggesting a feature request, please perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page/issues) to see if the suggestion has already been submitted.

- **User a clear descriptive title** for the suggestion
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why

### Pull Requests

While creating a Pull Request, fill out the [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

- **Do not** change design into a complicated and / or overwhelming experience
- **Do not** include issue numbers in the PR title if any
- **Include** screenshots or animated GIFs in your pull request if a new feature
- **Include** a link to the issue if any

#### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
